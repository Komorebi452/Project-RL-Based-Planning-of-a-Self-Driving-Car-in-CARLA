# Project-RL-Based-Planning-of-a-Self-Driving-Car-in-CARLA
Personal Project
This project used Carla, an open-source simulator based on a virtual engine, to create an urban road traffic scenario, train a self-driving car through reinforcement learning based algorithms to successfully pass the scenario, and evaluate the process and the results. The project involved the application of DQN algorithms and the training of neural network models such as CNN and Xception, using TensorFlow framework. The code and paper were published on Github.
