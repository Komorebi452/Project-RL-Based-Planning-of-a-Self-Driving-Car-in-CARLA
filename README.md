# Project-RL-Based-Planning-of-a-Self-Driving-Car-in-CARLA

This is a personal project which shows the implementation of training a self-driving car in the Carla simulator using a reinforcement learning based algorithm. The project uses Carla to create a simple urban traffic scenario and a car for training and applies DQN (Deep QNetwork) algorithm to train the car's planner. The goal of the project is to implement the process of training the car with existing algorithm and to evaluate the results.
The project trains a CNN and a Xception neural network model separately, and after comparing the data obtained through Tensorboard, the CNN is selected for further training. The result is obtaining a self-driving car that can drive normally on the road with a certain probability of avoiding obstacles. Although the planner of this car is not a good driver, it can continuously learn from the environment to improve its performance, which proves the effectiveness and potential of the DQN algorithm. By continuing to optimise the algorithm and solve some problems of the project, it may be possible to train a better self-driving car.
